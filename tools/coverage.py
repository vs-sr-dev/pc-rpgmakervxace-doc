"""coverage.py -- what share of an object is in a format somebody published,
stated over a named denominator.

This repository's coverage figure has always been a share of bytes whose
format has a published specification. On this object that figure is different
at every layer, so the tool takes the layer as an argument and prints the
denominator on the same line as the share. A coverage number without its
denominator is not a measurement.

    members  the twelve files the ZIP holds
    product  the files the four InstallShield containers hold, by the expanded
             size each container's own entry table declares
    tree     every file under a directory, classified BY MAGIC and not by
             extension, into FOUR buckets

THE FOURTH BUCKET, AND WHY IT HAD TO EXIST
------------------------------------------
The three buckets below were written for an object whose unopened remainder was
either vendor-specified or described by nobody at all. They do not fit an object
whose whole unopened remainder is **publicly reverse-engineered and never
specified by its vendor** -- Microsoft's ITSF, and RPG Maker's own LCF. Calling
those `published` would claim a warrant that does not exist; calling them
`neither` would deny work other people did in public and that anybody can check.
So there are four, and each has a membership test somebody who disagrees can
apply:

  SPECIFIED  a document describing the format was published by the party that
             created it, or by a standards body that adopted it, and that
             document is what an implementer works from.
  DECODED    no such document exists, and an independent published third-party
             reverse engineering does -- one this repository can name.
  DERIVED    this session worked it out of the bytes and can name no public
             account of it.
  OPAQUE     none of the above.

**The bucket describes the FORMAT's public standing, not this session's route
to it.** ITSF and LCF are DECODED here even though every field this repository
uses was derived from the bytes, because the question a bucket answers is
"could a stranger check this against something", and for those two the answer
is yes and the something is not this repository.

**And the buckets are never summed into a coverage figure.** They may be summed
into an ACCOUNTING figure -- do the bytes add up to the object -- because that
is a question about bytes. Coverage is a question about warrant, and warrants
of different kinds do not add.

A format counts as PUBLISHED when a specification exists outside this
repository: PKWARE's APPNOTE for ZIP, Microsoft's NE and PE, the MIDI
Manufacturers Association's Standard MIDI File, Microsoft's BMP and RIFF WAVE,
and plain text. It counts as DERIVED when this session worked it out of the
bytes: InstallShield's Z archive, its `_INST32I` container and its `.PKG`
manifest. It counts as NEITHER when nobody here opened it and nobody outside
has written it down: WinHelp 3.x, and RPG Maker's own `.DAT` and `.ATR`.

The three buckets are printed separately and are never merged, because
"derived by this session" is a weaker claim than "published by a vendor" and
folding them together would hide that.
